Hello everyone, I’m 吳若瑀, you can call me Ruby~ I grew up in Thailand and I have been there since I was a kid. It’s the first time I have to stay in Taiwan for so long, and I’m not used to it. I am a very shy person, and I am less likely to take the initiative to meet new people and find someone to chat with. But once you get to know me more, you will find that I am actually a person who talks a lot. I like Disney very much, especially Stitch. My favorite color is blue because Stitch is blue. I hope I can find someone who likes Disney like me in this class~
