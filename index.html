Hello everyone, I’m 吳若瑀, you can call me Ruby~ I grew upin Thailand and I have been there since I was a kid. It’s the first time I have to stay in Taiwan for so long, and I’m not used to it. I am a very shy person, and I am less likely to take the initiative to meet new people and find someone to chat with. But once you get to know me more, you will find that I am actually a person who talks a lot. I like Disney very much, especially Stitch. My favorite color is blue not only because Stitch is blue, but because blue is a very calming color and I would never get bored of it. I really like playing volleyball because I think it is a really cool sport and I wish I can play as good as the professional volleyball players.
